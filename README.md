# Learning Modern JavaScript

JavaScript is in pretty much everything and is almost everywhere. Along with HTML and CSS, it powers the web. It is inside a surprising number of desktop applications and is powering servers for companies both large and small. Microsoft, Google, and Facebook are all making significant open source contributions to an already impressive ecosystem.

For many developers, JavaScript is a fairly small and very expressive language that lets them leverage all sorts of amazing libraries to get interesting things done quickly - anything from serving a custom web site to flying a quad copter and everything in between!

This book is for beginner to novice programmers. So, I'm still going to leave a lot out. Seriously, there are a ton of great resources that show how to write a for loop. I'll recommend a few resources but I'm so not copying that here.

This book uses modern language features that are in most but not all browsers. Not to worry, some seriously smart people have made it reasonably easy for the rest of us to get the cool parts of JavaScript to run pretty much anywhere.

JavaScript comes in many flavors. This book covers a tiny fraction of the language and presents a very opinionated subset. I hope it serves as a useful introduction. Please know that everything I left out is very useful in some scenario or another. If I had time / room I would provide careful coverage of every last bit. Except for var. Good riddance to var.
