# Learning Modern JavaScript

## Why Bother?
JavaScript is in pretty much everything and is almost everywhere. Along with HTML and CSS, it powers the web. It is inside a surprising number of desktop applications and is powering servers for companies both large and small. Microsoft, Google, and Facebook are all making significant open source contributions to an already impressive ecosystem.

For many developers, JavaScript is a fairly small and very expressive language that lets them leverage all sorts of amazing libraries to get interesting things done quickly - anything from serving a custom web site to flying a quad copter and everything in between!

## Is this the Right Book for You?

This book is for beginner to novice programmers. So, it leaves a lot out. This book approaches the learning process a little differently. It is not a fundamentals first walkthrough of the language. Instead it attempts to show the important parts of the language as they are used by developers in their day to day lives.

## Tools

This book uses modern language features that are in most but not all browsers. Not to worry, some seriously smart people have made it reasonably easy for the rest of us to get the cool parts of JavaScript to run pretty much anywhere.

When explaining code, the book uses [es6console](https://es6console.com)so you can experiment with the sample code.
